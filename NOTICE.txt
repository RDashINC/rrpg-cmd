I - Developing.
-=========================-

If You plan on developing for this, in a windows (or unix envoriment, for that matter). You MUST use unix line endings! otherwise,
you will encounter many issues with bash that make no sense at all, some related to \r (Windows line ending symbol).

You have been warned!
